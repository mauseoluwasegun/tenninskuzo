# Tennis Ball Animation Fix Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the fix for the landing page tennis ball animation issue. The original implementation had only one bouncing tennis ball, but the requirement was to have three bouncing tennis balls.

## Changes Made

### Hero Component Update
The Hero component was modified to display three tennis balls instead of one:
- Added two additional tennis ball images
- Applied the same `animate-tennis-bounce` animation to all three balls
- Added staggered animation delays (0ms, 200ms, 400ms) to create a wave effect
- Maintained the same visual styling and glow effects for all three balls

### Animation Details
- All three tennis balls use the existing `animate-tennis-bounce` CSS animation
- Each ball has a different animation delay to create a sequential bouncing effect
- The balls are arranged horizontally with consistent spacing
- Each ball maintains the gradient glow effect and pulse animation

## Files Modified
- `src/components/Hero.tsx` - Updated to include three bouncing tennis balls

## Technical Implementation
The solution leverages the existing CSS animation infrastructure:
- Uses the pre-defined `animate-tennis-bounce` keyframes
- Applies `animationDelay` inline styles for staggered timing
- Maintains all existing visual effects (glow, pulse, gradient overlay)
- Preserves responsive design and mobile compatibility

## Visual Impact
- Creates a more dynamic and engaging hero section
- Enhances the tennis-themed aesthetic with multiple animated elements
- Provides visual interest through staggered animation timing
- Maintains performance by reusing existing animation definitions

## Testing
The implementation has been verified to:
- Display three tennis balls in the hero section
- Animate all balls with the tennis bounce effect
- Apply proper staggered timing to the animations
- Maintain responsive layout across device sizes
- Function correctly in both light and dark modes
